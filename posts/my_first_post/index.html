        <p>Welcome to my blog! I love sharing some of the craziest and funniest adventure stories I&rsquo;ve experienced so far. So let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<p>Imagine you went on a holiday! It would be amazing, right? But what if, on the last day of your return journey, you realized that your passport was lost with only hours left to board the flight back. What would you do? Well, this is just a hypothetical question, but what if it really happened?</p>
<p>This story began in the third week of April 2019. My brother had finished his 12th-grade board exams in Chennai, and it was time for him to take entrance exams. So, he was visiting one college after another. Finally, he secured a seat at SRM Chennai. My dad was abroad and had to accompany him for his registration, so he came to Chennai for a quick three-day trip. He arrived in Chennai on a hot sunny day, picked up my brother from his residential school, and rented a hotel room near the college.</p>
<p>The very next day was the day for his counseling. They woke up early, reached the college by 10 am, and found that the registration had already begun. It was a long day, with thousands of applicants waiting in long queues. Finally, by 4 pm, they completed the registration, and they were happy because my brother got the course he wished for, which was Mechatronics. Hungry, thirsty, and tired, they went to a nearby restaurant and indulged in a hearty meal before returning home around 8 or 9 pm. As my dad was about to fall asleep around 12 am, he suddenly realized that something was wrong—it was his PASSPORT! They started searching all over the hotel room but couldn&rsquo;t find it. Neither of them could remember where they had put it. My brother remained calm as usual, but my dad was in a panic because his flight was scheduled for early morning the next day. They rushed to the restaurant but found nothing. Feeling sad, worried, and unsure of what to do, they went to the college gate, but the security guard was puzzled to see two people at the gate at 1 am. Understandably, he didn&rsquo;t allow them inside and instead asked them to return at 7 am. My dad tried to explain his situation about the morning flight, but there was no solution. It was a sleepless night for my dad and brother. They kept retracing their steps and thinking of all the &ldquo;what-ifs.&rdquo; They tossed and turned in their beds, trying to pass the time. Meanwhile, my brother, the &ldquo;so-called genius,&rdquo; searched Google for solutions to finding a lost passport but found none. If they didn&rsquo;t locate the passports, my dad would be stuck in Chennai for at least a week, if not longer, to obtain a new passport.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, they rushed back to the college gate with their last hopes, and the security guard allowed them inside. The treasure hunt began, and they retraced their steps through the college, creating a map of their previous day&rsquo;s journey. Finally, they reached the last counter where they had paid the fees. However, the person who had been at the counter the day before was not present. They had to wait for a few minutes. When the person finally arrived, he took out a pouch from the top shelf and asked if it belonged to them. It was like winning the lottery for my dad. He called a taxi and rushed to the airport, dropping my brother back at his school. Ironically, my brother didn&rsquo;t end up attending that college; he went to Amrita Coimbatore for a degree in Computer Science and completed his internship just this year.</p>
<p>The events of that fateful day served as a powerful reminder that life can take unexpected turns in the blink of an eye. It was a tale of fortunate recovery, a passport was found just in the nick of time but the number of things that could happen if it wasnt found was unimaginable. I hope you enjoyed this blog! Looking forward to share more of such adventures here</p>
